Troublemakers (UDK)
-------------------
This folder only contains the source code and documentation for the 4 team capstone project which was meant to prototype a game in the Unreal Engine. This will not compile as many of the project files are excluded including all art and sound assets as well as the Unreal project files. This is meant more as a sample of the documentation and development process that was involved to create this prototype.

INSTALLATION:

There is nothing to install unless you create your own assets and build the solution from scratch. This uses an older version of Unreal Engine.
