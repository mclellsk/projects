Retro Runner (XNA/C#)
---------------------
Retro Runner is a conceptual demo of an infinite runner built using XNA. This demo makes use of the library that I built to accompany any development in XNA for my 2D platformer games. XNA is a microsoft coding library that is no longer supported so the library is no longer being maintained.

INSTALLATION:

Open the solution in the newest version of Visual Studio. You will need C# support and XNA Game Library 4.0. The RetroRunner folder contains all the demo related classes, while the folder called XNABaseLibrary contains all the classes for prototyping platformer games which can be reused for other XNA projects.
