BlockWorld (C++)
----------------
This is a small demo built using C++ and the glut library for OpenGL graphic utility. It simply renders a randomly generated height map where the blocks are coloured as a heat map. The camera allows the user to move around the scene.

INSTALLATION:

Open the solution in Visual Studio with the freeglut library installed (glut is no longer supported).
