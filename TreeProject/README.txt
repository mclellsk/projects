AVL Tree Project (C#)
---------------------
This project is a simple demonstration of an AVL Tree class in action. You can add nodes to the tree, remove nodes and search for nodes. It auto balances after every insertion and deletion. Duplicates are handled by simply incrementing the count for that particular node.

INSTALLATION:

Simply open the solution and run the Windows Form. The library contains the AVL tree implementation.
