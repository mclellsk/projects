Goat Bouncer (FlashDevelop/AS3)
-------------------------------
This was a project developed during a 48 hour window at the 8th annual Toronto Game Jam. This was built in a 2 man group, the concept, design, and development was all done within the window. It was built using FlashDevelop, Flixel, and Actionscript 3. All art was completed by myself, sound is royalty free, and programming was split between me and my team. 

INSTALLATION:

Setup FlashDevelop with the Flixel library installed. Open the Tojam8.as3proj and build the project. You may need to go into the project properties and setup the classpath to correctly reflect the location of the flixel library you installed. If you want to view the swf alone, you will need to use Adobe Flash Player 11.x, playing the swf through browsers with newer versions doesn't always work.
